        <h2>Creative Writing - The Despair of a Raven</h2>
        
        <h3><strong>Goal of the Project</strong></h3>
        <p>I collaborated with a high school student who had a strong interest in developing her creative writing skills. We decided to start with a short story, a format that effectively highlights both strengths and areas for improvement in a writer's technique. We began by discussing the essential elements of crafting a compelling story, including plot structure, character arcs, and setting. Through a series of brainstorming sessions, drafts, and revisions, the student honed her ability to create vivid imagery and emotional depth. Below is an excerpt from one of her stories.</p>

        <h3><strong>Excerpt</strong></h3>
        <p>Wizeria smirked, her eyes glinting mischievously. “Let’s stay off the road. If any of the scouts see us, they’ll link their deaths to us.” With a decisive nod, they veered right, heading towards the vast, unwelcoming desert. Raven dismounted her horse and laid down on the coarse, hot sand, feeling its roughness against her skin.</p>

        <p>“You saved the boy, but what’s the point? He’s as good as dead,” said Wizeria, taking a long, deliberate sip from her jug.</p>

        <p>“All it takes is a chance. Sometimes, it's the smallest probabilities that blossom into something great,” Raven replied, her voice filled with quiet determination.</p>

        <p>“And what about the two lives you took? What about their families?” Wizeria’s tone was sharp, almost accusatory.</p>

        <p>Raven fell silent, her mind swirling with thoughts she couldn't put into words. It was hypocritical to speak of saving lives when her own hands were stained with blood. She killed for a living, and the weight of that truth hung heavily over her.</p>

        <p>“There’s a lot of evil in this world. There has to be a balance,” Raven finally said, her voice barely more than a whisper.</p>
